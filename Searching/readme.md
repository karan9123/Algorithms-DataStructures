# Searching Algorithms

This folder contains implementations of various searching algorithms in C++. These algorithms are used to locate a specific element within a collection of data.

## Algorithms Included
The following searching algorithms are included in this folder:

- [**Linear Search:**](/Searching/LinearSearch/) A simple algorithm that sequentially checks each element of a collection until a match is found.
- [**Binary Search:**](/Searching/BinarySearch/) An efficient algorithm that searches for an element in a sorted collection by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

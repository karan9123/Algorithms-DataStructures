Let's consider a scenario where a vehicle is traveling along a circular route and has a limited fuel capacity. To complete the entire circular journey, the vehicle needs to visit all gas stations for refueling. Each gas station is located at a specific distance from the starting point, and has a fuel refill rate measured in units per distance traveled. The objective is to find the starting number of gas station to visit, ensuring the vehicle can successfully complete the journey by visiting all other subsequent stations.
